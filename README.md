# NoUnwantedLSStuff
Cydia tweak to remove slide to unlock text, all grabbers (NC, CC, camera), chevron (arrow), and the lock screen scroll view tap bounce

I use with LockPlus to make the themes look smoother and more fluid.

Uses code from https://github.com/codyd51/NoSTUArrow to hide the chevron (arrow).

This tweak is also found on my repo: http://repo.noahsaso.com
